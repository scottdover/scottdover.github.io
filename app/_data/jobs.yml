        Research Square is a company that helps academic researchers more effectively communicate their work.
        At Research Square, I'm a software engineer and architect for our researcher application. Here are a few
        ways I've served Research Square recently.

        - Worked to convert our legacy build process (a combination of grunt, bower, assetify, yui compressor, etc)
        to webpack
        - Created a handlebars templating framework to work with Redux, to give developers the ability to advance
        their skills while simulatenously supporting Internet Explorer 7+
        - Centralized four versions of our cart into a single cart process that addresses the needs of our partners
        and researchers
        - Worked with management to deprecate Internet Explorer 7 & 8, in order for React to become a
        feasible technology our developers use
        - Converted our handlebars-redux code to React, and am currently in the process of converting our
        legacy code into a single-page React / Redux powered application
        - Added javascript unit testing to our code base, and have been a continuing advocate to encourage
        our team to test their code
        - Created a pull request bot (posts PRs to Slack) as well as an accompanying UI to ease the transition
        of our team from Phabricator to Github
