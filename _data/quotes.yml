- Do you have somebody you can always count on? Do you know that if things get tough, you can message that person, and they will have your back? I do. His name is Scott Dover. The number of times Scott has helped me and others is huge. He is a hard worker in a team and is always willing to jump in into stretch goals. He was great at the loyalty program meeting, and he helped me with the cart rock issues that were arising on the fly. Moreover, he is eager to move the company forward and is contributing significantly to the future success of the cart.
- Not only is Scott a talented engineer, he is also a great communicator. He is able to see a problem from the lenses of different stakeholders and solving it effectively and collaboratively.
- Scott always knocks out tasks with speed and ease, but is still happy to discuss something that someone else is having trouble on. His helpful demeanor makes him a great person to work alongside.
- Scott is such a nice guy that it's easy to forget he's a Clemson fan.
- Aside from having gorgeous hair, this kid spent a good chunk of this quarter working on some of the ugliest tasks this company has seen since we removed modify_submission.php. And he did so without having an intimate knowledge of the code base. And he did so with a smile on his face. Which makes him either a sadist, or a really good developer.
- Scott is constantly working on improving our code; not just in ways that make developers happy, but in ways that our customers will notice and respond to. He packs in a bit of redesign into every feature he's tasked with adding and the result is the molding of a ten year old application into something modern and usable. He does it all humbly and with frequent check-ins with his teammates to make sure he's on the right path... even though he often already is.
- Scott's performance in Q1 was legendary.  He not only delivered outstanding individual results, but he consistently worked across the engineering team and the growth team to solve complicated problems.  Quite simply, our team members performed at a higher level because of him.
- Scott tirelessly pushes out code and helps us maintain a great pace of development. In addition to that, he is always willing to lend a hand when people have issues and is continuously cheerful about his work and everything around him. What a pleasure to work with him.
- Scott has been carrying a lot of the megatron split for his team and has shown incredible aptitude and willingness to learn and grow as a developer. He goes above and beyond every day, and I think his efforts should be acknowledged.
- The past quarter was difficult for the customer team. We were working in a code base we had very little experience with, swarmed with bugs we'd never encountered before, and adjusting to many changes in our way of working. Despite all of this, Scott stepped up and did a tremendous job in helping keep the customer team's head above water. If tasks were crystal methd, then Scott would have no teeth.
- Scott's work ethic and productivity in engineering has contributed enormously to this team over the past quarter, especially with respect to the project surrounding the Megatron split. He is also a creative, smart, and upbeat member of the team, making him a huge asset as a leader and a fun person to work with
