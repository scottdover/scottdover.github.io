        Research Square is a company that helps researchers more effectively communicate their work.
        Being a software engineer at RS, I've had the opportunity to work on projects in many
        different areas of the tech stack. Some recent examples are:

        - Working to optimize our apps to increase conversions for our Chinese users
        - Working with Jekyll and POEditor to provide a way to seamlessly localize our front-end sites
        - Creating a client-side search to provide dynamic search results for our static sites
        - Creating a Handlebars templating framework to work with Redux in support of our users with legacy browsers
