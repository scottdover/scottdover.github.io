                        Research Square is a company on a mission to make research publication faster and fairer for
                        everyone. My career at Research Square has given me the opportunity to tackle many large projects
                        that I'm proud of.

                                Early in my tenure at Research Square, I worked to reduce four order processes into a
                                single, consistent process, for all of our customers to use.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                to revisit their work, uncover areas of improvement, and give shout-outs to well-deserving
                                colleagues.

                            <li>
                                I worked on improving internal tooling, and introduced a

                                I worked over the course of multiple years to consolidate our unwieldy tech stack (Two
                                versions of a php framework, three templating engines, a few ways of building assets) into
                                something more manageable (an API backend with a React/Redux front-end).<br/>

                                I've worked with HR to update our survey policy to eliminate the use of gender-specific
                                identifiers, and have had a growing role in DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)
                                initiatives at our company.
