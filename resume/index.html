                                SAS is a data analytics company that provides software and services to help businesses make
                                better, data-driven decisions. There are a few meaningful things I've been able to work
                                on at SAS so far:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        I've furthered the development of a new version of SAS studio, a platform we're
                                        converting from a proprietary UI framework to more modern tooling (React/Typescript).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        I took on a secondary responsibility of developing our SAS extension for VSCode, and
                                        am now the lead the developer on that project. As a result, I've been nominated
                                        to attend/give a demo at SAS Innovate, a yearly conference for our customers and
                                        partners.

                                everyone. In my role as a Senior Software Engineer at Research Square Company, I've had a variety of new

                                        I worked more closely with our product team to help prioritize and scope projects
                                        and was responsible for facilitating daily standups and sprint planning.

                                        I worked with our China team to plan and deliver a new way of issuing Fapiao
                                        (a Chinese payment receipt) to our customers that obviates the need for a third-party
                                        vendor, saving us a significant amount of money in processing fees.

                                As a software engineer at Research Square Company, I had a wide leeway on how to architect a
                                new product and modernize existing products. My role gave me the opportunity to tackle many
                                large projects. Here are a few that I am very proud of:

                                        I streamlined four different e-commerce purchase processes into a single consistent
                                        system for our author services business line.

                                        I created a retrospective tool for our various Scrum/Agile teams across the company to

                                        I worked over the course of multiple years to consolidate our legacy tech stack
                                        (two versions of a PHP framework, three templating engines, several ways of building
