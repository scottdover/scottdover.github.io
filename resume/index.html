					<h3>Agile Assyst<i>Bowling Green, OH</i></h3>
					<h4>Web / iPhone Developer</h4>
					<p>
						Agile Assyst (formerly Remote Coach) is a piece of software catered to helping individuals with autism. Working closely with members of the education department at Bowling Green State University and the Autism Model School in Toledo, OH, we've discovered that video modeling in conjunction with a daily schedule provides a tremendous aid to people with autism. My current role in this project is to provide a web system that interacts with a previously created Android application to provide an interactive schedule for people with autism. In addition, I'm currently exploring components of the web system, including user location, schedule modification, and video / image uploading, that can be used in an iPhone application.
