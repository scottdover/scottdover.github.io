                    Research Square is a company on a mission to make research publication faster and fairer for
                    everyone. My career at Research Square has given me the opportunity to tackle many large projects
                    that I'm proud of.

                            Early in my tenure at Research Square, I worked to reduce four order processes into a
                            single, consistent process, for all of our customers to use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I cultivated developer happiness and understanding by creating

                            to revisit their work, uncover areas of improvement, and give shout-outs to well-deserving

                            I worked on improving internal tooling, and introduced a

                        <li>
                            I worked over the course of multiple years to consolidate our unwieldy tech stack (Two
                            versions of a php framework, three templating engines, a few ways of building assets) into
                            something more manageable (an API backend with a React/Redux front-end).<br/>

                            I've worked with HR to update our survey policy to eliminate the use of gender-specific
                            identifiers, and have had a growing role in DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)
                            initiatives at our company, including my contribution to deciding
