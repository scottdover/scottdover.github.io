  EverwondrNetwork.com is the marketing site to our product, <a href="http://everwondr.com" target="_blank">Everwondr</a>. Everwondr is an events network spanning the states of North 
  Carolina and Tennessee, covering a few hundred domains.

  This project was a chance to explore a few ideas I'd been toying with in my head. Like 
  other projects I've worked on, this was developed using the Slim PHP framework. 
  Unlike other projects I've worked on, this site responds almost instantly
  when clicking on any internal links.This is due to a small javascript function that pulls in JSON-ized page content, and binds it to the links as they are clicked. That, in combination with html 
  push states, make a web site that is as fast as possible.
