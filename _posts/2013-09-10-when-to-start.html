	This thought has been driving me crazy lately. I've been thinking about writing and what I should write about and how I should put together a blog and deciding what it should look like. I checked out a few blogs on <a external href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> to see what they were doing and I decided on a look and feel similar to the <a external href="http://svbtle.com">Svbtle Network</a> blogs. Here is an initial screenshot of the design I came up with.

	What I soon realized was that this was completely counter-productive to the writing process. Site markup and design are secondary to the content that is being presented. So, I decided to scrap it all (you can find the original, very rudimentary blog on <a external href="https://github.com/sdover102/Experimental_Blog">Github</a>) and start anew. This time, I wrote the copy first and worked on the design after. This, I've found, is the better process.

	Far too often people get overly concerned with planning and thinking that no action ever takes place. This is my last ditch effort to take action instead of being buried in my indecision making. I'll attempt to posting weekly. I may fail, but that's okay. The first step is to simply act.
