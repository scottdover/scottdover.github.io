<h2>Sin &amp; Temptation</h2>

<blockquote>
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
<br/>
<i>James 1: 2-3</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Temptation is as old as the creation story itself. It was just a short time after the Creator spun the universe into existence that Adam &amp; Eve fell to temptation by partaking of the Tree of Knowledge. It should come as no surprise that the enemy (I'm talking Satan here) was instrumental in tempting man to sin against God. Today's no different. Whether the temptation is anger, money, sex, drugs, the enemy is waiting, knowing what our weakness is, trying to cause us to slip.</p>

<p>Now I'm not saying we have no choice in the matter. We ultimately choose to give into the temptation (sin) or cry out to our Father for help. In that, it's important that we realize that our temptation is not our sin. This may be obvious to some, but it's something I've struggled with for a while now. So, if you, like me, occasionally get caught up in the "why am I feeling this way if I am following God,", don't worry. He's there to help, and he won't leave you hanging. Here's a point of reassurance that I've discovered as I've read through the word.</p>

<p>Three things to keep in mind. First, I may be wrong, and I'm okay with that. If there is something flawed in what I'm saying, let me know. I'm here to learn all I can about the Creator and how I can give my all back to him. Second, I'm not arguing at what point temptation becomes sin. There are lots of people who say different things about that, and I'm not qualified to even begin to go into detail (which is hard to even diagnose as everyone's temptation is different). Third, what I'm saying is never to "bible beat" anyone...it simply has helped me in my life, nothing more. With that in mind, here goes.</p>

<p>To say temptation is sin, is to deny Jesus as savior. I know, it's a bit of a bold statement. But, let me explain. First, the verse above says to "count it all joy" when temptation comes. If temptation were sin, this verse would say "count it all joy" when sin comes, but as Christians, we know this isn't true. Sin doesn't bring joy...forgiveness does. Second, consider Jesus who came and lived a sinless life. This sinless life enabled him to take the ultimate penalty &ndash; our sin &ndash; upon him so that we may be forgiven. Sound doctrine so far, right? Here's the kicker, Jesus was tempted. Check it out in Matthew 4<sup id="f2"><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Following the argument that temptation is in fact sin, means....Jesus was tempted, therefore he sinned. If he sinned, he is no longer sinless. If he isn't sinless, he couldn't take our sin. If he couldn't take our sin, then he was simply another man on a cross. If he was just another man on the cross, Christianity fails to exist and all of this talk about Jesus is nothing more than a story in history. </p>

<p>But, I serve a God who gave his son who took my sin and gave me his righteousness through Christ Jesus. In that I find peace and comfort. Like James, it's at that point I can find joy in the temptation, the pain, the troubles, the trials, the lowest valleys and the highest mountains. If the "trying of my faith worketh patience," then I am all for it. See, I'm not made for this world, and I long for the day when my faith becomes sight. </p>

<p>Until then, I'll need to patiently wait, fulfill my purpose, and pursue<sup id="f3"><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup> the God who created me. </p>
