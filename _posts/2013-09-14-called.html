<blockquote>
But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
<br/>
<i>1 Peter 2:9</i>
</blockquote>

<p>We are the called. We're not put on this Earth to do the possible, because the one that we serve doesn't work in the possible. We're called to live to be more than ourselves, to further a kingdom that will live long past us.</p>

<p>We're called to reach out to our friends, family, spouses, and fight for them. We're warriors. We fight the good fight of Faith, and we may lose some battles, but we're thankful that we know who wins.</p>

<p>We're called to love our wives and to provide for them. We're to realize that they are truly our other halves...with them we make one. Apart from them, we die. </p>

<p>We're called to be the leader in our families, to lift each member up and train them to be one of us, not because of who we are, but because of who God is in us. </p>

<p>We are the destroyers of pride and self, because those things are the destroyers of life. We may be weak, but the power we have in spirit supersedes any force we could fashion on our own.</p>

<p>Simply, we are called to do the work of God, and nothing less.</p>
