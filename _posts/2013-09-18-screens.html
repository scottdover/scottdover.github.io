<h2>Screens</h2>

<p><a id="#f1" href="#foot1"><img src="/img/screens.jpg" alt="Screens" /></a></p>
<p>I try to write, but the glowing screen catches my attention. It shows me images. Funny images, sad images, images where I don't quite get what I'm looking at, images of horror, images of love. They're all moving and have sound attached. I try to write, but the screen demands my attention.</p>

<p>Even when I'm away from the screen, I have my portable screen. It glows and shows me interesting articles of the latest tech news<sup id="#f2"><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>. It lets me know when I'm trying to be contacted. It lets me know the weather, how well a company is doing, and what my "friends"<sup id="#f3"><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup> ate for dinner last night. </p>

<p>Alas, even when I attempt writing, I'm doing it from yet another screen (still not the two screens I use for work). Nothing but a dark gray window and some white text. Dark window, light text...oh, and notifications. Little popups to let me know that company X has 15% off (Gotta unsubscribe, let distraction persist). Awesome, unsubscribed...no more pointless email. But wait, there are at least a dozen files on my desktop: screenshots, SQL files, side projects, the latest library from LayerVault<sup id="#f4"><a href="#foot4">4</a></sup>. All of these need to be organized. </p>

<p>And once that's done, I'll write. Right? Wrong. It's no wonder people turn to vlogging these days. It makes a lot more sense living life and recording it in front of the screen. Or, living life, then living it again...ugh, bad lighting...living it again, and again, and again. </p>

<p>Sometimes we get distracted and don't get anything accomplished, especially writing (which some would say isn't productive at all, but that's a whole different story). And, when it comes down to it, some glowing rectangle<sup id="#f5"><a href="#foot5">2</a></sup> is always there to please, to offer us a distraction, and to ultimately keep us from life. </p>

<p>The screen offers rehearsed and curated content, but pales in comparison to the ups and downs, the joy and suffering, that life has to offer. </p>

<p>Stop staring at the screens, start living. </p>
