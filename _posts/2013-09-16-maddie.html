<h2>Madeline Elizabeth Dover</h2>
<div class="h2sub">Mad&middot;ah&middot;lÄ­n</div>

<p>
Here are some ultrasound photos of our beautiful daughter who'll be with us this November. The doctor says everything looks good and she has a beautiful brain. She must get that from her mother. We didn't expect to have a baby this soon, but are so thankful that God's plan isn't necessarily our plan. I'm going to be Dad this November, and I couldn't be happier.
