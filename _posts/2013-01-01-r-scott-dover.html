<p>
  The Law Offices of R. Scott Dover is a single page website for an attorney
  in my hometown, Pickens, SC. 
</p>

<p>
  This project was important to me in a couple of ways. First, the attorney is my 
  uncle with whom I share my name. Second, I had the opportunity to go back for a visit
  and take some photographs. The photos in the slideshow are ones I took from around
  the Pickens area. The picture below was taken just a mile from my childhood home.

  This project was a great chance to help out a local business, reconnect with
  a high school classmate (now a partner at the firm), and work on developing
  my responsive design skills in a way that was enjoyable.

  As a side note, this project was created using the <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/" target="_blank">Slim</a>, a PHP framework developed by a company here in the state of North Carolina.
