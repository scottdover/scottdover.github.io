  <a href="http://madmonkinteractive.com" target="_blank">MadMonk Interactive</a> 
  is a company in Greensboro, NC that took a chance on me fresh out of grad 
  school and &ldquo;threw me in the deep end&rdquo; as Joe (my boss) liked to say.
</p>

<p>
  The initial result of this collaboration was a project for Downtown Greensboro.
  As my first exposure to CodeIgniter, this project got me off the ground and 
  running quickly. As the primary developer, the responsibility for the entire
  framework rested with me. And although the task was trying, the end result 
  was fantastic.

<p>
  We created a site to find everything you need in Downtown Greensboro. We even
  created a way for your to find restaurants matching your tastes from a variety
  of categories. Whether you are looking for a <a href="http://downtowngreensboro.net/dine/the-green-bean" target="_blank">good cup of coffee</a>, or a location for a <a href="http://downtowngreensboro.net/dine/liberty-oak" target="_blank">business lunch</a>, we made it all just 
  a click away.
