  The folks at C.R. Law were truly a joy to work with. My fondest memory was a 
  photo of one of the attorneys playing an air guitar. It's a shame that didn't
  make it to production.

  Like many of the sites I've worked with, this was the result of a combination 
  of CodeIgniter and Wordpress that made it simple to both blog and manage 
  details of the firm, like practice areas and their relationships to attorneys.

  One of my favorite pieces of this site is the <a href="http://crlaw.com/people" target="_blank">people</a> page. We took a small plugin we'd found online and turned it into something
  that is somewhat atypical for a law firm of their size. It was a pleasure to work
  with the C.R. Law team and a nice reminder that some attorneys are just fun.
