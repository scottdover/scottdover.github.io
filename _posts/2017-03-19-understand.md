Christians do not see muslims as muslims see themselves. Others do not see christians as christians see themselves. What we lack (myself included) is understanding.

My goal in this life is to understand and be understood. But, I'll never get there if I only talk to christians, or white people, or straight people, or men, or cisgender folks.
The struggle, then, is being vulnerable enough to sacrifice your opinion while empowering others to voice theirs.

Until you you can walk in someone else's shoes and understand their lives, your ability to be compassionate towards them is limited. Your ability to inspire change is reduced to contrived words falling on deaf ears.

You have to seek to understand if you ever expect to be understood.
