  William Peace University is a small college in Raleigh, NC that needed a face
  lift to accompany it's biggest shift, becoming a co-ed school. We provided a 
  custom CMS based on CodeIgniter to supply the university it's new web presence. 
  It was definitely a fun project to work with, and our contact, Justin Roy, made
  it a blast.

  The transition at Peace is one that was met with some ups and down, and one of
  the more humorous pieces of media put out for Peace was an Xtranormal video, below:

  Overall, it was still great to help them out, and a great experience to see
  a school slowly transform through some adversity.
