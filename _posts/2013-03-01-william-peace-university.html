<p>
  William Peace University is a small college in Raleigh, NC that needed a face
  lift to accompany it's biggest shift, becoming a co-ed school. We provided a 
  custom CMS based on CodeIgniter to supply the university it's new web presence.

  It was definitely a fun project to work with, and our contact, Justin Roy, made
  it a blast.
