<p>
	I'm selling my wife's old, somewhat busted IBM t43. I know, who wants a 5+ year old computer? Well, maybe that's you. What if I told you it had a LAMP stack setup just for you? That's right, you could pay $20 a month for your own <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode</a>, or, you could buy this machine for the low price of $140 and help out a developer. 
</p>

<p>
This machine has a whole 1Gb of memory and a hard drive sized at a whopping 73Gb. That's like, 100+ CDs. It's got a freshly installed version of Ubuntu 13.04 with the following tools installed:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A fully-functioning, ready-to-go, LAMP stack</li>
	<li>vnc4server, in case you want to control your computer with a computer (or iPad)</li>
	<li>btsync, so you can ditch Dropbox and show the NSA who's boss</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's wrong with it?</h3>

<p>
Over the years, this machines certainly taken a beating. If you're a huge fan of the 'w' an '[', this computer might not be for you (event though they still work). That being said, here's the issues:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The power charger is a little tricky (like jiggling a handle on a leaky toilet, you gotta get it just right)</li>
	<li>The bottom mouse buttons don't work (top ones do)</li>
	<li>No 'esc','w', or '[' key (but the buttons still work)</li>
	<li>The fan makes a bit of noise (more like a lawnmower, less like an airplane)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Whoa whoa whoa, $140 is a steep price</h3>

<p>
	Well, may be for some, not for others. Really, it's just a number. We can tweak it. If you have a remote interest in this machine, give me text, call, tweet, or email. Details at the bottom.
