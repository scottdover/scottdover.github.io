<h2>Blank Slates</h2>
<p>I love the feeling of a blank slate, a clean canvas to pour your creativity into. It's the thrill of something new that is so enticing. I guess that is why it often feels great to start a new project from scratch and less interesting to work on a huge, bloated project that has lasted way longer than it should. 
</p><p>
A clean slate gives you the ability to take the lessons you've learned in the past and apply them to the present. Over the course of a year, I've progressed my programming skills dramatically by creating systems from the ground-up, while slowly adding pieces that I know are "right" (which is extemely relative). This eventually leads to a system and a set of tools that you are comfortable and skillful with. 
</p><p>
In that way, coding is somewhat of an art form. Your initial works are good, but they're nothing to truly behold. You'll most likely look back and think you could've done much better. Maybe a better analogy is to a child who is learning to color. Sure, the effort may have been put forth, but colors flow outside of the lines and there's no consistency in the pressure / strokes. As time goes on, you get better at coloring in the lines and discovering what works / what doesn't. 
</p><p>
I guess the point I'm trying to make is that sometimes things start out messy, but if you have the will to learn, you'll find some pearls in your early works that you'll continue to refine until they reach fruition in your everyday work. The only thing you must consider is that this should always be one way. Things should always look worse in hindsight. If they don't...it sure makes you wonder if you're advancing at all. 
</p><p>
Anyway, this is the 1st in my 30 day blog series. I've been terrrible at writing and really want to get better at it. I'm the little kid with the crayon coloring outside the lines. Within a month, I'm sure to be somewhat better than I am now, right?
