I've been on a grace kick lately. Nicole and I have been talking about it and what it means. One small sliver of the implications of grace is giving effort as a Christian. For me, it's hard to talk about effort and not give the credit to God who works through you, but then it makes me wonder if it's my effort our simply God's. 
</p><p>
Here's what I've found to be true. The effort in my Christianity has little to do with actually doing what I feel God's telling me, and almost everything to do with my rationalization and reasons as to why I shouldn't do that. 
</p><p>
A simple example. I felt like I should pray with my wife before she left for work. I rationalized that I didn't need to and I would this evening and she knows how I feel and I pray by myself so why do I need to do it aloud. I spent all of this mental effort rationalizing why I shouldn't, but when I just did, it was effortless.

In other words, when you're "in Christ", doing what's not in your new nature takes more effort.
