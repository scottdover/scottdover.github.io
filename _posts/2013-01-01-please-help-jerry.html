  Please Help Jerry was a splash of color and a load of fun. The website itself
  is pretty straightforward...a big splash page, a bit of content, and a way to 
  get in touch. But the purpose was much more meaningful.

  Please Help Jerry was a project dedicated to getting members of Calvary Church
  involed in "being the church", volunteering their time and talents for the 
  purposes of the ministry. The central character, Jerry, played a part 
  in illustrating the fact that he just can't do it all by himself. See 
  one of the videos below.

  One fun part for me, in only the way a developer can enjoy, was getting them
  setup as efficiently as possible. Due to the nature of the project, a static 
  site was the best possible option for them. This allowed us to post the 
  site on Github pages and only pay for the cost of the domain.

  Overall, this project was a quick, focused project that I was thrilled to 
  be able to help with.
