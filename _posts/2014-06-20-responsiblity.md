It's Saturday morning, and that means getting the house clean. While cleaning and thinking over my upbringing, I stumbled upon what I think to be the most important lesson I was taught growing up. Considering some of my previous posts here, one might assume that it was the fact that I was encouraged to be at church any time the doors were open. And that's part of it, but it's not all of it. 

From an early age, I was given these terrible, horrible things that are just no fun at all...chores. And that's the way I saw it. Dad is giving me chores because it's less work he has to do. But, the underlying lesson was responsibility. That lesson came again when I was 15 and my dad told me I was going to get a job. There's no way I wanted to get a job. I mean, I could just ask my grandma for things I needed, right? However, against my will, I got a job at the golden arches asking "would you like 2 apple pies for a dollar?" That moment started the rest of my life. 
If not for that responsibility, I would've never met my wife. Without her, I may've never went to college...definitely not for 2 degrees. My life may have been very, very different...and I'm afraid it would've been for the worst. Without that responsibility, I wouldn't have pushed to go to church. I would've been fine with living a life devoid of any responsibility to God. I wouldn't have heard the sermons I heard at Dayspring, and my life today would've been much different. 

Because I am responsible, I've confronted my fears in my life and have taken steps to make sure my future is in good hands. I've not complained and whined about my student loan debt, because I know I'm responsibile to pay it back. I stood up for my beliefs at work, came to the mutual conclusion that it was time for me to make a change, and got a new job that's better in more ways than I can count. And now, I get the wonderful opportunity to raise a little girl that means the world to me.

Responsibility isn't easy...and it will most certainly cost you. The payoff won't be instant, but in the long-term it is so much more rewarding. It is the single most important lesson I've ever learned from my parents, and one Maddie will learn from me.
