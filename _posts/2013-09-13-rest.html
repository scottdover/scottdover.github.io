<h2>The Day of Rest</h2>
<p>A day of rest is such an odd concept for most people to grasp, but that's exactly what Sunday should be. Call me religious or lazy, but I think everyone deserves at least a day a week for a little R &amp; R. 
</p><p>
The only problem is that we tend to fight the rest. We turn Sunday into this day of productivity where we get the clothes washed and clean house and work on our side projects. 
</p><p>
But if you use this day to cram in more "stuff", how do you sustain that in the long run? Some people would argue that you get to a higher level of acceptance of less personal time, but I refuse to believe every moment has to be a "productive" one. 
</p><p>
Right now, I'm lying on the bed writing this short post on my iPhone. My wife lays next to me consuming her latest book. We have no plans or goals for the day but to simply enjoy the time we're given. And that's exactly the way it should be.
