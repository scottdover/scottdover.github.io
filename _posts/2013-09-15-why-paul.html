<h2>Why Paul?</h2>

<p>
Ever wonder why Paul was stricken with blindness on the road to Damascus? 
Why he was the one chosen to be the founder of the church? Why he is one of the 
most prolific writers of the New Testament?
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking about this for a while now, and the answer, as I see it, is a fascinating one. 
First, consider the fact that Paul is a Hebrew. Not only is he jewish, he is as devout as they come. 
Not only did he follow Jewish law, he enforced it. Paul was on his way to Damascus to persecute Christ 
followers, until God intervened.
</p>

<p>
From there, everything changed. Paul, enforcer of the law, became one of the leading founders of the Christian 
church. He was there at the day of pentecost and instrumental in spreading the word of Christ. The question 
remains, why Paul?
</p>

<p>
I believe the message so quickly through Paul because he intimately understood where the pharisees were coming
from. He understood how they thought, because he once thought the same way. He could understand their doubts, 
understand their reluctance, and ultimately be a guiding force in changing the hearts of many men. Paul had the 
position of leading many to Christ because he had already been through the experience. On top of that, he couldn't
be swayed by the misguiding efforts of others, because he had been on both sides of the fence.
</p>


<h3>Speaking From Experience</h3>

<p>
The takeaway here is that Paul was powerful in his writing and in his words because
he spoke from a point of experience and authority. <sup id="f1"><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In that regard, I'm confident that the only way to help someone through something is if you've been through it
yourself. For example, I have my own notions about how to run a business. I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1372023919&sr=1-1&keywords=rework" target="_blank">Rework</a>. The problem is, that's 
a book! It's not a business! I can't sell you on my business ideas, because I can't speak from a point of 
experience. Heck, my business ideas aren't even my own. They're simply modeled after ideals that I hold to.
In practice, they may shift dramatically.
</p>

<h3>Some Advice</h3>

<p>
When speaking to someone, speak from a point of experience. If you can't speak to the matter, don't. At best, you pull it 
off and the receiver is none the wiser. In the worst case, your loose understanding can offend, lead to miscommunication, 
and ultimately discredit your authority on the topic at hand.
