            <h2>Don't criticize the resolute</h2>
            <div class="date">2016.02.01</div>
            <p>As I was pulling into the grocery store parking lot, I couldn’t help but see in the window of the local Anytime Fitness. Rows of treadmills filled with people, all resolute on losing a few pounds. In that moment, my cynicism started to grow. “They’re going strong now, but give it a few weeks.”</p>

<p>This attitude, one I’m not proud of, seems typical amongst people who don’t share in the ritual of making resolutions. I’ve always seen them as a goal where people go in with high hopes, only to realize that they’d never thought about the effort needed, thus failing to follow through.</p>

<p>However, I’ve chosen to rethink that, and perhaps you should to. It must be true that at least one person will begin a life long commitment to better health, and will add years to their life that were slipping away due to poor eating habits and a love of the couch. Someone smoked their last cigarette. Someone chose to live boldly in the truth of who they are, and stopped living a lie.</p>

<p>The truth is, lots of those changes probably happened on New Year’s day, but the decision to change our life isn’t limited to a spot on a calendar. Someone, somewhere kicked their addiction today, or picked up a new habit that will change the rest of their days.</p>

<p>So, don’t waste your time criticizing the resolute. Instead, applaud their efforts, because one day (but perhaps not on New Year’s Day), you’ll start down a new path that’ll change your life, and that time may be better spent without the judgement and criticism of others.</p>
