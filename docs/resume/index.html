At Research Square, I’m a software engineer and architect for our researcher application. Here are a few
ways I’ve served Research Square recently.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Worked to convert our legacy build process (a combination of grunt, bower, assetify, yui compressor, etc)
to webpack</li>
  <li>Created a handlebars templating framework to work with Redux, to give developers the ability to advance
their skills while simulatenously supporting Internet Explorer 7+</li>
  <li>Centralized four versions of our cart into a single cart process that addresses the needs of our partners
and researchers</li>
  <li>Worked with management to deprecate Internet Explorer 7 &amp; 8, in order for React to become a
feasible technology our developers use</li>
  <li>Converted our handlebars-redux code to React, and am currently in the process of converting our
legacy code into a single-page React / Redux powered application</li>
  <li>Added javascript unit testing to our code base, and have been a continuing advocate to encourage
our team to test their code</li>
  <li>Created a pull request bot (posts PRs to Slack) as well as an accompanying UI to ease the transition
of our team from Phabricator to Github</li>
</ul>
