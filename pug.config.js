            'I nominate Scott every ASM for this award, and for good reason. They’re always a model of productivity, efficiency, and quality, even in “these strange and unusual times.” I probably message Scott more than anyone else at Research Square, and they are always available for questions, requests, or even just to chat. Scott is my favorite culture champion!',
            'Not only has Scott has been invaluable for his support of multiple Accounting projects, especially the implementation of retainer invoices to support prepayments, but he’s done so while also participating in a PM internal certification program and managing and supporting the implementation of the Zendesk Sunshine project, which was nominated for Innovation of the Quarter. He’s had a huge, positive impact on RS and is also a pleasure to work with. Thanks so much, Scott, for all your help!',
            'Our team has been operating without a third developer for several months now, though you’d never notice it. -- mostly because of Scott. Scott takes on a tremendous amount of work each sprint without complaint -- or even breaking a sweat. He even managed to move across the state last month, and still completed a fully-loaded sprint! I consistently aspire to be as productive and skilled a developer as Scott.',
            'I just love working with Scott. He is the person I want to have on my side when problems arise. He is always willing to help out, and jump in and take care of the fires. Thank you for being there, Scott.',
            'I’m really thankful that Scott is on the Customer Engineering Team. This quarter (and every quarter) he has done a lot to help our team, including managing our weekly release/deployment process and screening/interviewing candidates for the Software Engineer position. He also built and delivered the customer success/publication matching tool. This is a tool that the company has wanted for a very long time, and now we finally have it thanks in large part to Scott’s hard work. Thank you, Scott, for everything you do!',
            'I nominate Scott for every ASM, and for good reason. Scott shows up, in the realest sense of the term. He regularly goes above and beyond his daily job requirements, taking on additional projects and quietly improving every aspect of the work that our team does. He is my go-to for guidance and advice, and he is always patient with my (sometimes dumb) questions and issues. Scott truly owns the success of the business, every day.',
            "If I could describe Scott in one word it would be amazing developer. Scott continues to crank through dev tasks like a two year old tearing through wrapping paper. The amount of work he's able to produce is not only high quantity, but high quality as well.",
            'Scott took on project management and completion of a customer service rock aimed at testing the implementation of Zendesk Sunshine. Managing a project and working in Sunshine were both new to Scott, but he took on the challenge and succeeded. He’s been very communicative during the entire process and has been helpful in helping us decide how to best implement Sunshine. He definitely has embodied all of our cultures values during this project, and it’s been a delight working with him!',
            'I’m not a developer, but my understanding (and all that I hear from others) is that Scott has contributed at a very high level to the Megatron split this quarter--sprint after sprint. And, you’d never know it by talking with him--his humility is just as impressive!',
            "Scott is awesome. He is super responsive to issues and effective in resolving them. He is also great about reaching out to make sure he understands any bug and their impact. It's really great to get to work with Scott.",
            "As a local employee, it can sometimes take significant effort to maintain rapport with remote colleagues. Scott consistently makes an effort to engage socially with myself and our other team members, and does so without sacrificing his extremely high level of productivity. Whether it's pointing out a funny programming language feature or comment in the code base, or just checking in to see how I am doing, Scott's messages are often highlights of my day. His attitude and his approach to being a team member truly exhibit many of our core values.",
            'Scott is so awesome. The customer success tool he built in Q4 will help our business in so many ways and addresses a long time need. I’m tremendously grateful for all things he does on projects big and small.',
            'Scott has spent a lot of time this "quarter" patiently helping me take on new, technically complex tasks. I bombard him with questions and requests on a seemingly daily basis and he always takes the time to answer me, without judgment and without solving the problem for me. It\'s this last bit -- the *way* in which he answers my questions -- that is perhaps the most notable. His ability to explain *how* without doing *for* makes Scott a true Culture Champion.',
            'Scott is a terrific team player. He consistently steps up within his team to take on more and more issues. Whether it has been tackling bugs or working on things like the Split Rock. Scott was a Rock-Star (pun intended) when it came to doing the Split Rock for the Customer team. He has tackled it with efficiency and grace. He works hard to enable the success of others within his team and does a great job working outside his team. His focus is to do what’s best for the company. He does all this very quietly and with a lot of humility. He truly is a great example of what we desire here at Research Square.',
            'Scott is always thoughtful in his work, especially when it comes to creating user-facing features. He seeks out input from everyone, and it shows in the results!',
            'Wow dude, just, wow. I feel like I always nominate Scott for an award, and for good reason. He quietly accomplishes SO MUCH — every sprint he goes above and beyond his already tremendous workload to update outdated parts of the code base, implement new features, and solve long-standing bugs. And all of this work barely seems to phase him — he still makes himself available for my near-daily questions and requests for help, and I know I’m not the only one who regularly turns to him for guidance and advice. Scott definitely, and regularly, enables the success of others and owns the success of the business, and I’m thrilled to get to work with him!',
            'Early in the quarter, there was a major update to the Rubriq site, but with it came a rough week of instability. Scott was indispensable in tracking down and resolving all the bugs.',
            'Scott always commits himself to take on tasks that require creative thinking. He makes innovative contributions to the team, and is great at communicating help to other developers.',
            'In his short tenure here, Scott has become a very impactful member of the scholarship dev team, taking on a significant number of issues each sprint and then moving swiftly through the backlog of bugs and new features. He’s responsive and friendly and fun to work with. He has been a great addition to our company and the team!',
            'Scott has joined relatively recently, and he has been an amazing addition to the team. His work is always of very high quality and he always has time to help fix things.',
            'He continues to do amazing and thoughtful work. He is also a great communicator by making sure his stakeholders can easily do client reviews with ample instructions.',
            'Scott and I have been working closely in this quarter on [a] UnionPay Fapiao project and a few other tasks. Customers were thrilled to know that they can receive Fapiao by using UnionPay card. I am very grateful for Scott’s help to make this UnionPay project happen. We can imagine this task required a lot of work, but Scott made it! After its launch, there were a few glitches, I can’t remember how many times I bothered him with bugs, and he handled all of those very patiently. Thank you, Scott! It was a pleasure to work with you.',
            'Scott is my hero this quarter for all of his work on adding Fapiao to UnionPay payments. This was an incredibly challenging project because it involved collaboration and complicated testing with organizations in China. Scott always exhibits tremendous patience, kindness, and professionalism, and these qualities were especially evident during this large and important project.',
            'Scott spent weeks of his life tackling one of the most complicated engineering feats of the year: setting up Fapiao for UnionPay. In doing this, he had to work with Chinese payment processing vendors who knew very little English. He had to work all hours of the day to get this project done. And over the last two months, we are seeing tremendous results: we’ve had nearly 160 researches use this payment option in the month of September.',
            'The past quarter was difficult for the customer team. We were working in a code base we had very little experience with, swarmed with bugs we’d never encountered before, and adjusting to many changes in our way of working. Despite all this, Scott stepped up and did a tremendous job in helping keep the customer team’s head above water. If tasks were crystal meth, then Scott would have no teeth.',
            'Scott has had to learn and work in an entirely new codebase this quarter. I have been very impressed by how quickly he has managed to pick it up and master it. I am also very impressed by his level of communication. He is not afraid to stop and ask questions when he has a problem. I don’t work with Scott often, but I look forward to the opportunities when I do.',
            'Scott’s work ethic and productivity in engineering has contributed enormously to his team over the past quarter, especially with respect to the project surrounding the megatron split. He is also a creative, smart, and upbeat member of the team, making him a huge asset as a leader and a fun person to work with.',
            'What’s better than a National Championship? This award, of course!',
            'His guidance through difficult tasks helped me overcome newbie issues, he is a great influence and team mate.',
            "Scott is simply amazing. His speed of completing tasks coupled with his willingness to go out of his way to help anyone in a bind is a powerful combination. We forgot something when releasing a portion of the Workflow Decoupling project? No problem--Scott already has a fix out. We need a couple more tasks to help support line-item discounts? Done before the sprint even starts. I'm so grateful to Scott and everything he does to support our team. Thank you!",
            'For holding the fort on frontend work on the customer team, and being able and willing to tackle additional problems even though not asked. What a guy. I am always very impressed by him.',
            "Scott is such a gem. Honestly. He is both patient with all of everyone's questions and ideas and tremendously thorough in the work he does which helps us, as a team, to deliver the highest quality website experience to our customers.",
            "I nominate Scott every quarter because it's impossible not to. He's constantly thinking about how to improve things, talking about the next giant project he's got planned, and, before you can even blink, has it completed; the whole time with an infectiously positive attitude. Also, have you read his mini biographies on the kick-ass women we're naming our sprints after?!",
            'I know, I know, members of the selection committee can’t receive awards. But I can’t _not_ nominate Scott every ASM, because he’s an essential part of our team, and probably the Square I lean the most heavily on for help! Scott is always patient and helpful, and frequently helps me troubleshoot challenging (and sometimes just dumb) issues with code, or development environment, or design.',
