                    Hi there! I'm Scott Dover, a software engineer at Research Square, a company on a mission to make
                    research publication faster and fairer for everyone.

                    I'm also a budding cyclist, a proud member of the LGTBQIA+ community, an even prouder father, and am
                    generally not great at talking about myself so this is bound to get awkward. Enjoy!

                    I've had the pleasure of working with some amazing folks over the years. Most recently, my time has
                    been spent as a Software Engineer at Research Square. In the last several years there, I've made the
                    following contributions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I've converted a monolithic, decade-old code base from a disparate set of technologies (zend
                        framework 1, zf3, jQuery, assetify, grunt, and more) to a code base using a predictable feature
                        set (laminas, react, redux, and webpack).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I've created internal tooling to aid in developer happiness and productivity, including a
                        [pull request bot](#) that posts notifications to Slack about open PRs, as well as a
                        [Retrospective](#) tool we use to aid in sprint planning & review.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I've taken our companies Project management internal certification program, and have
                        successfully pushed a company-level [rock](https://www.eosworldwide.com/blog/is-that-really-a-rock)
                        from ideation to completion (along with countless smaller projects I've lead, championed,
                        and engineer through the years)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I've worked to increase inclusivity in my workplace, including: Being an active participant in
                        Research Square's DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) committee, leading a change in company
                        policy around the use of non-gender neutral terms in personnel surveys, and advocating for a
                        year of focusing our sprint names on [Kick-ass women](#) in history.

                <p>
                    Before Research Square, I worked for Pursuit Of Happiness, the parent company of Everwondr: An
                    events management network that works closely with CVBs (Convention and Visitor Bureaus) around
                    North Carolina.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Pursuit Of Happiness, I had the opportunity to re-build an events management system from the
                    ground up, as well as be the one-stop-shop for all things web-related. As the sole developer, every
                    layer of the webstack was my responsibility.

                <p>
                    Last, every story has its start. Before I was recruited by the team at Pursuit Of Happiness, I had
                    the honor of getting to know them as clients of a consultancy I worked for, MadMonk Interactive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At MadMonk, I had a diverse set of clients to work with, on a variety of projects. I would not be
                    exaggerating to say I'd spend one day working on an e-commerce site for a chicken coop salesman,
                    and the next working on a custom content management system for a local university.

                    The bedrock of my career has been built on a few guiding principles: Don't waste people's time & energy,
                    reduce ambiguity and increase clarity as much as possible, put forth your best effort, and spend time
                    improving the lives of your fellow engineers, because more cohesive teams produce better results.

                Last, I have truly been in the company of some remarkable people over the years, and I'm humbled by the
                kind words they've shared about me. A selection of their kind words can be found below
